    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This spreadsheet contains detailed weather data provided by the New York State Mesonet. There are two datasets (see worksheet tabs) located in the Bronx (Latitude=40.87248, Longitude=-73.89352, Altitude=57.5 meters) and Manhattan (Latitude = 40.76754, Longitude = -73.96449, Altitude = 94.8 meters). These two weather stations are located at the southern and northern ends of the ground traverse data (see \"Location\" tab). The data was collected near the surface (2-meters height) every 5 minutes during the day. This data may be useful for your AI model as it contains air temperature, wind speed and direction, and solar isolation (solar flux at the surface). \n",
    "\n",
    "### How might you use this data?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Temperature and Relative Humidity - These data were collected by the sensor at 2-meters height, near the ground. Since these data points are not part of the core challenge dataset, they should only be used for reference. As a note, when temperature is combined with relative humidity, it yields a \"heat index\" which is the apparent temperature experienced by the human body. High values of \"heat index\" have been known to contribute to health issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Wind Speed and Direction - It may be possible to use this information in your model. For example, wind speed and direction may impact the local mixing of air at the surface depending on local building geometries. Such variations in air mixing could impact local urban heating conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Solar Flux - It may be possible to use this information in your model. For example, solar flux is the amount of solar energy that reaches the ground which is impacted by cloud cover and building shading. When combined with building footprint, building height, and sun angle data, it may be possible to predict the shading conditions for specific locations on the ground. Such information could impact local urban heating conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How was temperature data collected for this challenge?\n",
    "\n",
    "The core temperature data for this challenge was collected using ground traverses in cars. The data was collected in the afternoon from 3:00pm to 4:00pm. The data was then converted to a UHI index using the actual temperature at any location divided by the mean temperature of the dataset. \n",
